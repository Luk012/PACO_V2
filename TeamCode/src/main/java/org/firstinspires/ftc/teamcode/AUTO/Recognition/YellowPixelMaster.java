                 * from the camera sensor can be rotated such that it is always displayed with the image upright.
                 * For a front facing camera, rotation is defined assuming the user is looking at the screen.
                 * For a rear facing camera or a webcam, rotation is defined assuming the camera is facing
                 * away from the user.
